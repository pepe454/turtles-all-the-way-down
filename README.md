# Turtles All the Way Down

Create spiral images with varying colors. 
Set configurations in spiral_drawing.py to create different patterns

## Spirals are started by drawing squares such that each side goes just past the following corner
![](images/example1.jpeg =200x)
## In the next iteration, the endpoints of the sides are the new corners, with each line being drawn just past the next corner
![](images/example2.jpeg =200x)
## A couple iterations later
![](images/example3.jpeg =200x)
  
  
## Different color schemes can be chosen to create a more vibrant picture
![](images/summer.jpeg =200x)
  
  
## Apply a gradient using the shad configuration to create a fading effect
![](images/ocean.jpeg =200x)
  
  
## Set the rotate configuration to create rotating colors
![](images/carousel.jpeg){width=50%}.
